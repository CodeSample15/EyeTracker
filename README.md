# EyeTracker
Using artificial intelligence (mediapipe) to 3d track someone's face and eyes and display where they are looking on the screen.

The challenge is to create an eye tracking program that can be used by anyone who doesn't want to purchase eye tracking hardware for their future projects.
If you feel like downloading the code to follow allow with what I'm trying to do, go ahead. It's not perfect, but it works well enough for someone else to expand on it.
